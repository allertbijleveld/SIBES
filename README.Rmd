# SIBES

SIBES stands for Synoptic Intertidal BEnthic Survey. The goal of the *SIBES*-package is to conveniently load, process, and explore SIBES-data on abundance, biomass, median grain size and mud content. The basic workflow is covered in this readme document and illustrated with this flowchart: 

![flowchart](/man/figures/flow_chart_SIBES.png)

# Installation

You can install the latest version of SIBES from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r install the package, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
## install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/allertbijleveld/SIBES", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

# Download the data

Data will be available via open access after publication of the accompanying data paper. Now, the data can be downloaded here: https://doi.org/10.25850/nioz/7b.b.ug 

Data are available after a three-year embargo or earlier upon request. The data come in three ‘csv’ files containing (1) metadata of sampling stations and sediment characteristics (‘samples.csv’), (2) species found on the mudflats of the Dutch Wadden Sea (‘species.csv’), and (3) biomass and abundance per species per sample station (‘biota.csv’). 

# Loading the package and data

All three SIBES csv-files can be conveniently loaded with the function *sibes_load*. By providing the folder containing the three csv-files, this function loads the SIBES data into a list containing three data frames ('biota','species','samples'). If the names of the downloaded csv-files have been modified, these can be provided with arguments.

```{r load-Data, message=FALSE}
library(SIBES)

## load the three SIBES-csv files from a folder
	# data_list <- sibes_load(directory_path = '')

## for convenience, load the example dataset provided within the package
	data_list <- get('SIBES_dataset')
```

# Species exploration  

To conveniently search for  species, *sibes_species_search* allows either to browse the species based on part of a species name or id. 

```{r species search, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## browse the list of species available
	sibes_species_search(data_list[["species"]], Key='39') 			# using sibes_id
	sibes_species_search(data_list[["species"]], Key='57|34|67') 	# multiple ids
	sibes_species_search(data_list[["species"]], Key='aren') 		# using part of the name	
```

# Species selection

```{r species select, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,include = TRUE}
## data can be selected with the search function, which 
## could be convenient for selecting multiple species
	# data_list[['biota']] <- sibes_species_search(
	#							data_list[['biota']], 
	#							Key='39') # also includes sibes_id 339

## select only one species 
	data_list[['biota']] <- sibes_select(
							data = data_list[['biota']], 
							filters = "sibes_id == 45" 
							)
```

# Aggregating data per sampling station

If more than one species is present within biota, it needs to be aggregated per sampling station. In this example, it is not necessary because we only selected one species in the previous step (*sibes_id == 45*). 

```{r If multiple species aggregate, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = TRUE}
## aggregate the species data into biota
	data_list[['biota']] <- data_list[['biota']] %>%
							group_by(sample_id)  %>%
							summarize(
								abundance_m2 =  sum(abundance_m2), 
								afdm_m2 =  sum(afdm_m2)
								)
```

# Merge 'biota' and 'samples' 

The biota tibble only contains data for sampling stations that had animals. To also include sampling stations where the selected species (or species group) was not found, the data 'biota' and 'samples' need to be merged. The function *sibes_merge* will merge (left_join) the data frames 'samples' and 'biota' contained in the list obtained with *sibes_load*. The list entry 'samples' is necessary for running this function.

```{r merge the data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
	data_m <- sibes_merge(Inputdata = data_list)
```

# Data exploration

Here, we provide a few examples exploring the data. First, select a subset of data. Second, explore the numbers of samples in the data set. Third, expolore changes over time in a trend plot. Fourth, map the distribution of biomass, abundance, etc.

## Spatiotemporal selection

Subset the merged dataset for a particular area, time period, and/or year. 

```{r select the data}
## select data for particular tidal basins 
	data_selected_1 <- sibes_select(
							data = data_m, 
							filters = c(
								"tidal_basin_name %in% c(\"Eierlandse Gat\",\"Vlie\")" 
										)
									)

## select data for a sampling time period
	data_selected_2 <- sibes_select(
							data = data_m, 
							filters = c(
									"between(
										date,
										as.Date(\"2008-01-01\",format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"),
										as.Date(\"2021-10-26\",format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")
											)" 
										) 
									)
					
## select data for range of sampling station ids and dates
	data_selected_3 <- sibes_select(
							data = data_m, 
							filters = c(
									"between(sampling_station_id, 320,335)", 
									"between(
											date,
											as.Date(\"2010-01-01\",format=\"%Y-%m-%d\"),
											as.Date(\"2020-08-11\",format=\"%Y-%m-%d\")
											)"	
										) 
									)	
```

## Numbers of samples

```{r basic information, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE,include = T}
## get the number of samples per year in the selected data
	table(year(data_selected_2$date))

## get the number of times a station occurs in the selected data
	table(year(data_selected_3$date),data_selected_3$sampling_station_id)
```

## Trend plot 

```{r Temporal plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include = TRUE}
## First, we need to average values per year
	data_selected_2_per_year <- data_selected_2 %>% 
								  group_by(year(date)) %>%
								  summarize(abundance_m2 =  mean(abundance_m2))

## plot the trend
	plot(data_selected_2_per_year$`year(date)`, 
		data_selected_2_per_year$abundance_m2,
		xlab = "year", 
		ylab = "mean abundance", 
		main="trend plot",
		type='o',
		pch=16, 
		cex=2
	)
```

## Plot map 

The function *sibes_plot_map* can be used for easy mapping. in tha plots, light grey areas show intertidal mudflats and dark grey areas show land.

```{r Map plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## Map distribution across whole SIBES-extent
	
	## before mapping, we need to average over years (or select one year to plot)
		data_selected_2_per_sampling_station_id <- data_selected_2 %>% 
										group_by(sampling_station_id) %>%
										summarize(
											x = x[1], 
											y = y[1],
											median_grain_size = mean(median_grain_size),
											percentage_mud = mean(percentage_mud),
											abundance_m2 = mean(abundance_m2),
											afdm_m2 = mean(afdm_m2),
											n_years = n()
												)

	## plot the number of years a station was sampled 
		sibes_plot_map(
			Inputdata = data_selected_2_per_sampling_station_id,
			attribute = "n_years",
			ticks = 10,
			cex_map = 0.25
			)
	## plot median grain size 
		sibes_plot_map(
			Inputdata = data_selected_2_per_sampling_station_id,
			attribute = "median_grain_size",
			ticks = 10,
			cex_map = 0.2
			)
	## plot afdm  
		sibes_plot_map(
			Inputdata = data_selected_2_per_sampling_station_id,
			attribute = "percentage_mud",
			ticks = 10,
			cex_map = 0.2
			)


## Map distribution on a selection of tidal basins
	## first the selected data need to be grouped 
		data_selected_1_per_sampling_station_id <- data_selected_1 %>% 
										group_by(sampling_station_id) %>%
										summarize(
											x = x[1], 
											y = y[1],
											median_grain_size = mean(median_grain_size),
											percentage_mud = mean(percentage_mud),
											abundance_m2 = mean(abundance_m2),
											afdm_m2 = mean(afdm_m2),
											n_years = n()
												)
												
	## plot biomass
		sibes_plot_map(
				Inputdata = data_selected_1_per_sampling_station_id,
				attribute = "afdm_m2",
				ticks = 10,
				cex_map = 0.5,
				cex_legend_labels = 0.7)
```
